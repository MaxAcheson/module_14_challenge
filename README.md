#Trading Algorithm Bot

This project creates a machine learning bot that aims to test different trading strategies and compare them by reviewing graphical and numeric data.

## Technologies

This project utilizes python 3.7 along with the following packages:

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 

[scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

[jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/)

This project has been constructed in a [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) notebook entitled `machine_learning_trading_bot.ipynb`.

## Installation Guide

1. Make sure you are using python version 3.7 or greater by typing the following:

`python -V`

2. Confirm that the packages are installed by using the following code lines:

`pip install tensorflow`

`pip install pandas`

`pip install matplotlib`

`pip install jupyterlab`
